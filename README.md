# Lightning Network Study Notes

This repository contains my public learning notes on the Lightning Network,
with an emphasis on reliability, failure handling, and node operations.

## Focus Areas
- Channel lifecycle
- HTLCs and failure scenarios
- Fee management concepts
- Liquidity constraints
- Node monitoring fundamentals

## Goal
To build a solid foundation before contributing code or tooling to Lightning
Network projects.

Notes are updated incrementally as I learn.
